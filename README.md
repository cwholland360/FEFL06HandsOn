Bootstrap Practice Hands-On

Requirements
Use the Bootstrap CDN to bring Bootstrap into your project.

Using your new knowledge of Bootstrap to create a web page that contains the following:

A Form that includes:
First Name input
Last Name input
Phone Number input
Email input
Submit Button
Cancel Button
Your First Name and Last Name inputs should appear in the same row with "Full Name" as the prepended text. (No label elements should be use for First and Last names)
Your form should use form groups and input groups to group the labels of the other inputs.
Add a paragraph about yourself after the form along with your picture.
Use the grid system and breakpoints to make the picture appear above your bio when the screen is small, and side by side when the screen is medium sized or larger.
Use a theme from www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/ instead of the default theme
